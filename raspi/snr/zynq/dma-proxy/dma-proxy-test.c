/* DMA Proxy Test Application
 *
 * This application is intended to be used with the DMA Proxy device driver. It provides
 * an example application showing how to use the device driver to do user space DMA
 * operations.
 *
 * The driver allocates coherent memory which is non-cached in a s/w coherent system.
 * Transmit and receive buffers in that memory are mapped to user space such that the
 * application can send and receive data using DMA channels (transmit and receive).
 *
 * It has been tested with an AXI DMA system with transmit looped back to receive.
 * Since the AXI DMA transmit is a stream without any buffering it is throttled until
 * the receive channel is running.  
 * 
 * More complete documentation is contained in the device driver (dma-proxy.c).
