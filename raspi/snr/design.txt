SNR Architecture
Similarly to ROS, SNR offers a pub-sub paradigm where separate components are 
handed each other’s data. Hierarchically speaking, the highest level components
are “nodes.” Nodes are self contained instances of SNR’s entire stack. 
Contained within each node is a database and a task queue. Tasks represent
events relevant to the behavior of the system, such as receipt of sensor
data or instructions for packets to be sent. The database stores the actual
data referenced by these events in “pages” that represent a key-value pair.
Task and data pages are respectively scheduled and stored by “endpoints.”
Endpoints produce and react to events and data. Endpoints provide the 
functionality that makes decisions and controls the hardware of a robot.
Endpoints are specified at the time of construction of a node. Endpoints
may have their procedures run either synchronously with the node’s event loop 
or not. If not, the endpoint will have it’s own event loop in a separate thread
or process. Due to the requirement of these asynchronous capabilities, many 
refactorings were needed to ensure safe multiprocess operation. These concepts 
are well taught in CPE 453 Intro to Operating Systems and CPE 542 Advance 
Realtime Embedded Systems.
