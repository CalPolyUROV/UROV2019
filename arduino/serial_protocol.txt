Serial Protocol

Communication between Raspberry Pi inside the robot and the Arduino compatible
MCU inside the robot. The combination of these devices have been selected 
because the Pi excels at robust sockets communication and the Arduino provides 
extensive PWM control capacity. PWM control using the Pi is not feasible due to 
timers that interrupt in order to create PWM signals.

Data to be moved:
6 thruster values ranging from -400 to 400
